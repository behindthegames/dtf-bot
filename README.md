# DTF.ru game info bot by RAWG.io 

A game information bot for a video games media [dtf.ru](https://dtf.ru) (in Russian).

Games information API is provided by [RAWG.io](https://rawg.io) â€” the largest video game database and video game discovery service.

It monitors comments for game names in brackets (like [GTA 5]) and replies with game info and store links.

It uses [public DTF.ru API](https://www.notion.so/API-TJ-vc-ru-DTF-3f5162d2cb184f6381ff82c085bbb3c0) (Russian) and rawg.io [python bindings](https://pypi.org/project/rawgpy/) by laundmo.

Disclamer: 
1. I am not a professional software developer;
2. this code was not reviewed by one;
3. this is a weekend project;
4. here be the dragons.
